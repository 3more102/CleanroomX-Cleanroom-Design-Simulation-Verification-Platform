# CleanroomX Architecture

## Release scope

CleanroomX v0.100.0 is a Python 3.11+ engineering screening, simulation, verification, uncertainty/provenance, HVAC, fan/network, qualification, and reporting platform. The desktop application is an operator shell over the same backend modules used by the command-line tools. v0.100 adds application execution provenance, portable external-file path handling, atomic persistence/exports, and backend-evidence fan/system plotting without duplicating validated solver equations in the GUI.

## Layers

1. **Engineering backends** — calculation, solver, uncertainty, qualification, HVAC, fan/network, dossier, consistency, and report modules under `src/cleanroomx/`.
2. **Application service registry** — `src/cleanroomx/application.py` defines the desktop workflow catalog and validates unique workflow keys, parser/runner contracts for ordinary workflows, custom `consistency`/`dossier` adapters, and callable parser/runner/reporter targets.
3. **Project persistence** — `src/cleanroomx/project.py` implements the `cleanroomx.project` schema, strict JSON validation, supported legacy migration, duplicate-id and active-analysis checks, and atomic temporary-file replacement on save.
4. **Recovery persistence** — `src/cleanroomx/autosave.py` owns separate versioned recovery artifacts, source-file fingerprints, bounded rotation, asynchronous write/coalescing, recovery scanning, validated restore preparation, and path-confined artifact deletion. It never writes the explicit project path.
5. **Recovery presentation** — `src/cleanroomx/recovery_ui.py` presents startup recovery candidates, comparison evidence, read-only inspection, explicit discard, and restore selection without owning project state or persistence decisions.
6. **Desktop UI** — `src/cleanroomx/gui.py` provides project lifecycle, JSON editing, validation, non-blocking execution, per-analysis result ownership, diagnostics, reporting, export, plotting, dirty-state tracking, unsaved-change protection, recovery-autosave status, protected recovered working copies, and active-run mutation guards.
7. **CLI entry points** — `pyproject.toml` exposes CleanroomX commands for verification, HVAC, recovery, uncertainty, qualification, networks, fan studies, dossier/consistency, and the desktop GUI.
8. **Verification/provenance** — solver-specific modules retain compatibility, replay, integrity, residual, convergence, coverage, and deterministic reporting evidence. CI preserves explicit v0.91-v0.95 compatibility gates before the complete suite.

## Desktop data flow

A project file is loaded through `load_project_document()` and migrated only when it matches a supported legacy shape. The selected analysis kind maps to a fixed application-registry entry. Ordinary workflows pass through declared parser and runner functions; consistency and dossier use explicit custom application adapters. Results are normalized to strict JSON and rendered through the backend reporter when available.

Result ownership remains tied to the analysis id so stale results are not silently reassigned after edits, deletion, or analysis switching. Project saves serialize schema version 1, validate the resulting document, and use an atomic replacement.

Recovery autosave is deliberately outside the project schema. The UI captures a model snapshot plus raw draft state on the Tk thread and submits it to a single background writer. Recovery artifacts are atomically written in a user-specific recovery directory, retain source-project fingerprint evidence, and are bounded by project identity. Explicit saves remain authoritative; recovery artifacts are never substituted for or written over the project file.

Startup recovery revalidates the embedded project document and refreshes the source comparison before any restore is applied. A selected snapshot becomes an in-memory protected working copy. The original source path is retained only as relative-reference context; normal Save is redirected to Save As, and the first recovered save is forbidden from targeting that source path. This preserves both source and recovery-derived versions until the operator has explicitly established a new saved file.

## Engineering boundary

CleanroomX produces screening and numerical/provenance evidence. It does not by itself establish ISO cleanroom certification, CFD validation, commissioning/TAB acceptance, manufacturer approval, physical/statistical uncertainty, or regulatory compliance. Applicable requirements and acceptance criteria remain external project inputs.
