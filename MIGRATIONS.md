# CleanroomX Project Migrations

## Current schema

CleanroomX v0.99.0 writes desktop projects using:

- schema: `cleanroomx.project`
- schema version: `1`
- application version: the installed CleanroomX version

The implementation is in `src/cleanroomx/project.py`.

## Supported legacy migrations

The loader currently migrates two legacy shapes into schema version 1:

1. `cleanroomx.project` schema version 0 containing a single `analysis` object.
2. A legacy single-analysis object with top-level `analysis_type` and `input` fields and no `schema` field.

Both are converted in memory to the current project model with one analysis and an active-analysis id.

## Rejection rules

The loader rejects malformed JSON, non-finite JSON constants such as `NaN` and `Infinity`, unexpected schemas, non-integer schema versions, unsupported future/older schema versions after known migration, unsupported analysis kinds, non-object analysis inputs, duplicate analysis ids, and invalid active-analysis references.

Unknown future project formats are rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Save behavior after migration

Loading a supported legacy file does not overwrite it automatically. If the migrated project is saved, CleanroomX writes schema version 1 using the current document model. Saving is validated first and uses an atomic temporary-file replacement.

For controlled archival workflows, retain a copy of the original legacy file before saving the migrated project.
